# University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School LaTeX Dissertation & Thesis Template (unofficial)
(Last Updated: August, 2023)

This unofficial University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School dissertation template in LaTeX is based on the work of [Derek J. Dalle](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dalle/codes/thesis-umich/), but has been updated to reflect Rackham's latest requirements. The template will likely fall out of sync with Rackham requirements at future times, but we'll do our best to keep it up to date with your help! Please feel free to clone it and fill it with your own work!

The easiest way to use it is through the corresponding [Overleaf Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-michigan-dissertation-template-unofficial/tpnjzndnrzmf) by clicking "Open as Template." Otherwise, you can download the files to your computer and upload them to [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) or compile locally if you prefer. If you have a paid or group membership on Overleaf, you can [import your cloned version directly](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_push_a_new_project_to_Overleaf_via_git%3F), although it's less-direct than the title would suggest.

If you're interested in helping us make this the best it can be, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're always happy to discuss ways to improve the template.
