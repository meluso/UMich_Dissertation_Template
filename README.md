# University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School LaTeX Dissertation Template (unofficial, 2020)

This unofficial University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School dissertation template in LaTeX is based on the work of [Derek J. Dalle](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dalle/codes/thesis-umich/), but has been updated to reflect Rackham's requirements as of May 2020. The template will likely fall out of sync with Rackham requirements at future times. Please feel free to clone it and fill it with your own work!

One of the easiest ways to use it is by downloading the files to your computer and uploading them to [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com). Otherwise, if you have a paid or group membership on Overleaf, you can [import your cloned version directly](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_push_a_new_project_to_Overleaf_via_git%3F), although it's less-direct than the title would suggest.

Big thanks also to Suzanne Chou and Shreyas Kousik for your contributions!

Suhak Lee made a few changes for his 2021 Ph.D. thesis that has passed the Rackham criteria.
